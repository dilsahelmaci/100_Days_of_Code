# 100 Days of Code in Python!

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding in Python repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey through the **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** course on Udemy. Here, you will find all the projects, exercises, and code snippets I wrote during this 100-day coding challenge. Hopefully, it will be good practice for me (and maybe for you 👀) at the end! 🚀

## Course Overview

This course is designated to help anyone practice and master the Python programming language by building 100 different projects over 100 days.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's code contained in its own directory:
<pre>
100-Days-of-Code/
├── Day01/
│   ├── ProjectName/
│       ├── main.py
│       └── README.md
│   ├── ProjectName/
│       ├── main.py
│       └── README.md
├── Day02/
│   ├── ProjectName/
│       ├── main.py
│       └── README.md
├── Day03/
│   ├── ProjectName/

## How to Use This Repository
 1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dilsahelmaci/100_Days_of_Code.git
```
2. **Navigate to a day's directory**: Each directory is labeled by day. Navigate to the desired day's directory to see the code and mini-project for that day.
3. **And run the code**: Open the `main.py` file for each day in your preferred Python IDE or text editor and run the code.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Dr. Angela Yu and Udemy for creating this comprehensive and engaging course.

_This repository is a work in progress now and will be updated daily as I complete each day's coding challenge._

Happy coding! 🐍🐍🐍
